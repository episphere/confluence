                            <li> Step 2: Researcher submits a study concept describing their project via the Confluence Data Platform. It is sent to the relevant consortia data access coordinating committees (DACCs) that govern the requested data. </li>
                            <li> Step 3: Researcher receives approval from relevant data governors. Relevant consortia DACCs first review and either approve or reject the study concept. If approved, the individual studies contributing the requested data will be notified and determine if their study will participate in the approved project. </li>
                            <li> Step 4: Researcher signs a data transfer agreement (DTA) for the study concept with each of the relevant consortium data coordinating centers (DCCs) governing the requested data (see Particiapting Consortia for list of DCCs). </li>
                            <li> Step 5: Researcher receives access to the request data from the DCCs, following execution of DTAs. </li>
